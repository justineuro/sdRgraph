Description: This package contains an R function that requires four (4) arguments: 
  nx - number of levels in the SD scale, e.g., 5
  sl - scale labels as a list, e.g. c("SA","A","N","A","SA")
  ny - number of descriptor items in the inventory
  x - data matrix: 
    col1: low-end descriptors
    col2: high-end descriptors
    col3-onwards: mean of the scale values for each group
  The names of the columns beyond the second (col 3 and above) of the data matrix (e.g., dimnames(x)[[2]][3: ncol(x)]) are used for labelling the groups in the legend.
